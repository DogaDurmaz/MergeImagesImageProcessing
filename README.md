# MergeImagesImageProcessing
Python language / OpenCV library / Image Processing


 

my aim is to seamlessly merge images chosen together, as a result, they appear as one cohesive image. The method of integrating numerous photographic 
photos with overlapping fields of view to generate a panoramic image is known as image stitching. In 
this homework, we learn the implementation of an image stitching algorithm using the Scale 
Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and affine geometric transformations.
